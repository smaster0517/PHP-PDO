## Why use PDO? (PHP Data Objects)
This is so because the legacy mySQL has been replaced by mySQLi and PDO.
There are virtually no proper tutorials or websites demonstrating how to use PDO available either. Hence this is also my attempt to learn PDO as well.
NOTE: Do keep in mind that I was never much good at the legacy mySQL either, so please don't hold it against me! :)
